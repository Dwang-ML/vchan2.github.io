You are asked to prepare a dish that resembles an approximation to the volume of a solid with 2D base and geometric cross sections. You are also required to calculate the theoretical volume of your given solid using integration.

After completing your recipe, you are requested to share a 3-6 minute video with a taste test and thorough description. You may use <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lgmIvdLAB8bP-I9BFeY5zqiO0uGjhP0V/view?usp=sharing">Dr. Vince’s</a>, or <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E3T25-3Uy4rBvck6k4NuuAfgNY9HRlTT/view?usp=sharing">Mr. Merrick’s</a> vidoes for reference. You are also encouraged to include your cooking performance, and tips and tricks within your video.

You may work individually, or in teams of 2 or 3.

You will be given a score based on a 40 point scale marked on three categories:

Portrayal of approximation method through your recipe and video description (10 points)
Beauty, style and performance of food and video (10 points)
Creativity (10 points)
Taste (judged purely on your reaction to first bite, 10 points)

GOOD LUCK
