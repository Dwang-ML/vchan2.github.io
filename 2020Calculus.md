### Updates

<!--
<b>NOTICE:</b> Master Aaron has changed the deadline of the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/Challenges/2020-21Winter_Break.pdf"> Winter Break math challenges </a> to Dec. 31. Please submit to <a href="mailto:vincent.chan@renertschool.ca">vincent.chan@renertschool.ca</a> with the subject "MAHMC Solutions"
-->
<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "AP Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays (location TBD) as a mandatory period for those who are pursuing AP Calculus this year or next year. This gives us an additional period of instruction every week, since we are behind schedule. Should we get back on track with my desired schedule, I will turn this into an optional period.

<!--
<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays in my zoom room. Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others.

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 8 on Choice Fridays (location TBD). Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. 


<b>NOTICE:</b> The Renert Tutoring Centre is running help sessions via zoom for this class. See Schoology for details.

<!--
Section 3.5 corrections:
  * Q8 should be 20 &#215; 3^(1/4) ~ 26.32, not 20/sqrt(3) ~ 11.55.
  * Q15 is technically incorrect: the question tells you the plane is 20 km from Quinton, so that should mean direct distance (indeed, you are looking for the rate of change of the distance, which they are assuming means direct distance). If you assume the 20 km refers to horizontal distance (but you're trying to find the rate of change of direct distance still). then their answer is correct, 240 &#215; sqrt(5). However, the correct interpretation should yield 300 &#215; sqrt(3). If I were to use a question like this on a test, I would explicitly state "when it is 20 km horizontally from Quinton" vs "when it is directally 20 km away from Quinton" or something to that effect.

<!--
<a href="https://forms.gle/xAm1p13AZw4eG1jD9"> Chapter 5 test submission </a>
Chapter 5 test scheduled for Wednesday, Dec. 16 - Tuesday, Dec. 22. 
You should be proficient in sections covered in Chapter 5 (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4). More precisely:

  * Know how to find intervals of concavity (up or down)
  * Be able to find points of inflection (which requires a knowledge of what a point of inflection even is)
  * Know how to apply the Second Derivative Test
  * Be able to identify or provide a sketch for a function given the sign of f, f', and f''. More generally, be able to identify or provide a sketch for a function given information about a function, such as domain, intercepts, symmetry, asymptotes, intervals of increase/decrease, local/global extrema, intervals of concavity, and/or points of inflection.
Note that 5.5 and 5.6 are not explicitly covered on the test, but may be useful in developing your understanding.

  * Be able to determine intervals of increase and decrease of a function.
  * Be able to find and classify local extrema (using the First Derivative Test).
  * Be able to find global extrema (using the algorithm for continuous functions on closed and bounded functions, or the First Derivative Test for global extrema - you may also use the Second Derivative Test for global extrema, but this will not be explicitly tested)

Submit <a href="https://forms.gle/iWJDnZnungUpbKDy6"> here</a>
-->

<!--
Chapter 3 test tentatively scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 19 - Thursday, Nov. 26. Note that the test is designed to be completed in 45 min, so it's a short one; it will only be weighted half as much as Chapter 1 or 2.
You should be proficient in all material covered in Chapter 3 (sections 1, 2, 5). More precisely:
  * Be able to determine the velocity and acceleration of a particle moving in a straight-line given its position/displacement function as well as compute the value of the velocity or acceleration at particular times.
  * Be able to determine when a particle is at rest as well as when it is moving in the positive or negative direction.
  * Find the total distance travelled by a particle within a specified amount of time.
  * Find rates of change in contexts other than motion
  * Be able to solve related rates problems (you should know standard formulas for area/volume and perimeter/surface area, and be able to use simple geometry such as similarity and Pythagorean Theorem)
-->

<!--
Chapter 2 test is scheduled for <b>Saturday, October 24 - Thursday, October 29</b> in the exam centre. 
You should be proficient in all material contained in Chapter 2. More precisely:
  * Be able to compute a derivative from first principles.
  * Be able to approximate the value of a derivative from either a table or graph.
  * Be able to sketch the derivative of a function given a graph of the function and vice versa, the graph of a function given the derivative.
  * Be able to apply the various derivative rules: sum/difference rule, constant multiple rule, power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule (this is of course the vast majority of the test, either directly or indirectly)
    * Note: This is true both for given functions as well as given a table of values for f(x), g(x), f'(x), g'(x).
  * Be able to use derivatives to find the equation of tangent/normal lines with a given slope and through a point or parallel/perpendicular to given lines.
  * Be able to compute dy/dx implicitly, and to find the slope of the tangent to an implicit curve at a point.
  * Be able to compute higher-order derivatives.
  * Be able to compute higher-order implicit derivatives.
There will also be several bonus questions which test your understanding at a deeper level.
Hours are:
  * Saturday, October 24, 11AM-2PM
  * Monday, October 26, 4PM-7PM
  * Thursday, October 29, 4PM-7PM
I will not be answering questions regarding Chapter 2 starting Thursday, October 22 at 4PM, treating it as if the exam has started for everyone. This also means that you are not to discuss any aspects of the test with anyone until after Monday at 7PM, in order to maintain integrity of the exam. Please let me know ASAP if you cannot write at one of these times, and we will have to make alternate arrangements (such as during class).

  * Demonstrate converting a repeating decimal to a fraction in lowest terms
There will also be several bonus questions which test your understanding at a deeper level.
