### Updates

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays in 2405. Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. 

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be opening my zoom room in period 5 on Tuesdays if you have any questions.

Chapter 1 test is tentatively scheduled for <b>Monday, September 28 - Saturday, October 3</b> in the exam centre. 
You should be proficient in all material contained in Chapter 1 plus limits at infinity and types of discontinuities. More precisely:
  * Know how to compute a limit of a function both graphically and algebraically via 4 techniques:
    * Technique 0: rational-like function evaluation
    * Technique 1: factor and reduce
    * Technique 2: rationalize
    * Technique 3: (for x approaching +/- infinity) divide by highest power in the denominator
  * Know how to compute a one-sided limit, including checking for signs in absolute values and values close to 0
  * Know how to compute a limit via one-sided limits
  * Determine where a function is continuous, or find values for constants which give continuity 
  * Be able to identify the type of a discontinuity
  * Be able to compute the slope and equation of a tangent line from first principles (i.e. the limit of the quotient definition)
  * Know how to find velocity and other rates of change (i.e. applications of slope) from first principles
  * Be able to compute the average rate of change or approximate the instantaneous rate of change from a table of values or graph
  * Be able to compute limits of sequences (geometric, using the dividing by highest power trick, or identifying the behaviour in general)
  * Be able to compute the sum of a series, either using the limit of the partial sums or, in the special case of a geometric series, using the formula derived in class
  * Demonstrate converting a repeating decimal to a fraction in lowest terms
  
There will also be several bonus questions which test your understanding at a deeper level.

Hours are:
  * Monday, September 28, 4PM-7PM
  * Thursday, October 1, 4PM-7PM
  * Saturday, October 3, 11AM-2PM
  
I will not be answering questions regarding Chapter 1 starting Monday, September 28 at 4PM, treating it as if the exam has started for everyone. This also means that you are not to discuss any aspects of the test with anyone until after Saturday at 2PM, in order to maintain integrity of the exam. Please let me know ASAP if you cannot write at one of these times, and we will have to make alternate arrangements (such as during class).

### Homework

Homework expectations: 30-40 minutes/day on average

Homework for Wednesday, September 30, 2020:
  * Do problems from 2.2 and 2.3. 
  
Homework for Monday, September 28, 2020:
  * Practice for your test! 
  * Read 2.2 and 2.3. 
  * Complete both Desmos "Card Sort: Derivative Match" and "Sketchy Derivatives" activities
  
Homework for Thursday, September 24, 2020:
  * Practice for your test! 
  * Finish the rest of 2.1. 
  * Finish the Desmos "Card Sort: Derivative Match" activity from class
  * Complete the Desmos "Sketchy Derivatives" activity
  
Homework for Wednesday, September 23, 2020:
  * Practice for your test! 
  * Focus especially on things you did poorly on today. Maybe it was finding discontinuities of a piecewise function, maybe it was the limit techniques, whatever.
  * Finish 2.1 except for Q2, 3, 13, 16 (these require more graphical understanding, and while you know how to do it by now, I haven't done explicit examples in class yet).
  * I'm going to say it again: if you struggled with composition of funtions in math 30, any additional time you have should be spent on re-learning how to identify compositions and what the components are.

Homework for Monday, September 21, 2020:
  * Practice for your test! 
  * If you want to get a head start on Chapter 2 material while *still practicing for your test*, try to find the slopes of tangent lines via the limit of the Newton quotient. 
  * If you are worried about your grasp of Math 30 material and want to practice 1 thing that will help immensely in the weeks to come, re-visit your Math 30 notes on *composition of functions*. Know inside-and-out how to identify the functions which make up a compound function, since I will assume this as prerequisite knowledge and will not spend class time on it.

Homework for Thursday, September 17, 2020:
  * Do problems from 1.5 and 1.6 (If you don't finish 1.6, that's fine - the weekend is coming up. However, the more you do now, the more prepared you will be for asking questions on Friday in Captivating Calculus.)

Homework for Wednesday, September 16, 2020:
  * Do problems from 1.4
  * Start problems from 1.5
  * Start reading 1.6 and 1.7 - the aim is to finish these by the end of Thursday's class.

Homework for Monday, September 14, 2020:
  * Do problems from 1.3. I realized that you actually *do* have all the information you need to answer every question, since we talked about what continuity is yesterday. What we haven't talked about is *types* of discontinuites, which the textbook doesn't ask for - next week, I will discuss this and ask you to go back to classify the discontinuites in 1.3.
  * At this point, you have all the calculus knowledge necessary to answer questions from 1.4 and 1.5 as well, though you'll need to understand the interpretation of the formulas we've been using. You should at least read 1.4 and 1.5.

Homework for Thursday, September 10, 2020:
  * Do problems from section 1.2
  * Do problems 1-8 in the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020Calculus/01%20-%20Limits%20at%20Infinity%20(Kuta).pdf"> "Limits at infinity" worksheet </a> (Q9 and on are optional for now). Solutions are on pages 3 and 4.
  * Read section 1.3

Homework for Wednesday, September 9, 2020:
  * Do problems from section 1.1
  * Read 1.2 and start trying some problems (you don't need to finish all of the problems)
  * Extra: This is a long weekend - if you struggle with math or are worried about the material, *read ahead*! We will eventually be covering all of chapter 1.

Homework for Thursday, September 3, 2020:
  * Join the Schoology course.
  * Sign the course outline, have your parents sign it, and bring it to class.
  * Finish your "biography sheet" with the 4 questions.
