### Updates

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays in 2405. Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. 

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be opening my zoom room in period 5 on Tuesdays if you have any questions.

Chapter 2 test is tentatively scheduled for <b>Monday, October 19 - Saturday, October 24</b> in the exam centre. 
You should be proficient in all material contained in Chapter 2. More precisely:

  * Be able to compute a derivative from first principles.
  * Be able to approximate the value of a derivative from either a table or graph.
  * Be able to sketch the derivative of a function given a graph of the function and vice versa, the graph of a function given the derivative.
  * Be able to apply the various derivative rules: sum/difference rule, constant multiple rule, power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule (this is of course the vast majority of the test, either directly or indirectly)
    * Note: This is true both for given functions as well as given a table of values for f(x), g(x), f'(x), g'(x).
  * Be able to use derivatives to find the equation of tangent/normal lines with a given slope and through a point or parallel/perpendicular to given lines.
  * Be able to compute dy/dx implicitly, and to find the slope of the tangent to an implicit curve at a point.
  * Be able to compute higher-order derivatives.
  * Be able to compute higher-order implicit derivatives.

There will also be several bonus questions which test your understanding at a deeper level.

Hours are:
  * Monday, October 19 28, 4PM-7PM
  * Thursday, October 22, 4PM-7PM
  * Saturday, October 24, 11AM-2PM
  
I will not be answering questions regarding Chapter 2 starting Monday, October 19 at 4PM, treating it as if the exam has started for everyone. This also means that you are not to discuss any aspects of the test with anyone until after Saturday at 2PM, in order to maintain integrity of the exam. Please let me know ASAP if you cannot write at one of these times, and we will have to make alternate arrangements (such as during class).

Chapter 1 test is scheduled for <b>Monday, September 28 - Saturday, October 3</b> in the exam centre. 
You should be proficient in all material contained in Chapter 1 plus limits at infinity and types of discontinuities. More precisely:
  * Know how to compute a limit of a function both graphically and algebraically via 4 techniques:
    * Technique 0: rational-like function evaluation
    * Technique 1: factor and reduce
    * Technique 2: rationalize
    * Technique 3: (for x approaching +/- infinity) divide by highest power in the denominator
  * Know how to compute a one-sided limit, including checking for signs in absolute values and values close to 0
  * Know how to compute a limit via one-sided limits
  * Determine where a function is continuous, or find values for constants which give continuity 
  * Be able to identify the type of a discontinuity
  * Be able to compute the slope and equation of a tangent line from first principles (i.e. the limit of the quotient definition)
  * Know how to find velocity and other rates of change (i.e. applications of slope) from first principles
  * Be able to compute the average rate of change or approximate the instantaneous rate of change from a table of values or graph
  * Be able to compute limits of sequences (geometric, using the dividing by highest power trick, or identifying the behaviour in general)
  * Be able to compute the sum of a series, either using the limit of the partial sums or, in the special case of a geometric series, using the formula derived in class
  * Demonstrate converting a repeating decimal to a fraction in lowest terms
There will also be several bonus questions which test your understanding at a deeper level.

### Homework

Homework expectations: 30-40 minutes/day on average

Homework for Thursday, October 15:
  * Practice for your Chapter 2 test!

Homework for Wednesday, October 14:
  * Do problems from 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9.
  * Reflect on your Chapter 1 test and write down:
    * Issues you may have had (not understanding something, not writing enough proof, calculation errors, etc) (If you did well, reflect on why you were successful)
    * What you will do in the future to prepare for tests

For Chapter 2 test, remove all additional functions)
