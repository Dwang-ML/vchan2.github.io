AP Calculus Final Exam on Monday, May 24, in-school.

<!--
<b>Notice:</b> In Stewart, 9.3 Q7, 8, 15 use integration by parts - skip it.
FYI: the sections 7.6 and 7.7 in the third packet I handed out (contains CA #1 and CA #2 for each section) are good additional practice for the differential equations test.
For 7.7, Q5 and 7 on CA #1 and CA #2 are related to section 7.4, which we haven't finished yet, and will not be tested. 
(Packets can be found in their usual spot, shared notes -> textbook chapters and practice problems -> Unit 7)

<!--
I wanted to clarify something we did in class that I spoke about, but didn't write down explicitly: the derivative of arccos(cos x) is only for sure 1 on the interval [0,&pi;], where we're using the restricted domain. I want to emphasize that this is not the "true" derivative in the most general sense, which is actually 1 on the interval [2&pi;n,&pi;+2&pi;n], and is -1 otherwise. I leave as an exercise to see why, either using the chain rule or reducing the argument in arccos(cos x) and using reflection identities. We'll talk more about this at a later time, when we get into AP calculus material.

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays in my zoom room. Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. Please note that if we do fall behind again, I will be using the "Captivating Calculus" as a mandatory class instead, but I'm hoping it won't come to that - in fact, I'm hoping we'll be finished with the material early, to give plenty of time for practice.

This gives us an additional period of instruction every week, since we are behind schedule. Should we get back on track with my desired schedule, I will turn this into an optional period. This runs until Friday, March 26. Since we have the option of writing a delayed AP test, I'm optimistically going to not offer an "AP Calculus" class on Fridays in round 4 of Choice Friday.

Section 3.5 corrections:
  * Q8 should be 20 &#215; 3^(1/4) ~ 26.32, not 20/sqrt(3) ~ 11.55.
  * Q15 is technically incorrect: the question tells you the plane is 20 km from Quinton, so that should mean direct distance (indeed, you are looking for the rate of change of the distance, which they are assuming means direct distance). If you assume the 20 km refers to horizontal distance (but you're trying to find the rate of change of direct distance still). then their answer is correct, 240 &#215; sqrt(5). However, the correct interpretation should yield 300 &#215; sqrt(3). If I were to use a question like this on a test, I would explicitly state "when it is 20 km horizontally from Quinton" vs "when it is directally 20 km away from Quinton" or something to that effect.

    * Q3: Option A should read "h \to 0", not "a \to 0" under the limit.
    * Q11: This is not a great question, but is correct if you assume the scale is exactly the same as above. You need to have good eyes! (or a ruler...) If I had this on a test, I would put the graph of f on the same axes so you can directly compare them.
    * Q12: This is beyond the class material (and is flawed - none of the choices are correct).
    * Q14: Come see me if you need an answer.
    * Q16, Q18: Requires a calculator - ignore for the purposes of the test, but try it out to test your understanding.
    * Q19: Should read df/dx, not dy/dx (or it shoud say y = ... rather than f(x) = ...)
    * Q29: Options A and C are identical.
    * Q31: Notation: D_x means d/dx, and D_x^2 means d^2/dx^2.
    * Q33: This is (algebraically) challenging, and has several answers (one which uses the original formula to simplify, and one which does not - both versions are valid in my mind).
    * Q42, Q43: These questions are part of Chapter 3, not Chapter 2.
