### Updates

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays in 2405. Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. 

<b>NOTICE:</b> The Renert Tutoring Centre is running help sessions via zoom for this class. See Schoology for details.

Chapter 3 test tentatively scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 19 - Monday, Nov. 23. Note that the test is designed to be completed in 45 min, so it's a short one; it will only be weighted half as much as Chapter 1 or 2.

You should be proficient in all material covered in Chapter 3 (sections 1, 2, 5). More precisely:
  * Be able to determine the velocity and acceleration of a particle moving in a straight-line given its position/displacement function as well as compute the value of the velocity or acceleration at particular times.
  * Be able to determine when a particle is at rest as well as when it is moving in the positive or negative direction.
  * Find the total distance travelled by a particle within a specified amount of time.
  * Find rates of change in contexts other than motion
  * Be able to solve related rates problems (you should know standard formulas for area/volume and perimeter/surface area, and be able to use simple geometry such as similarity and Pythagorean Theorem)

<!--
Chapter 2 test is scheduled for <b>Saturday, October 24 - Thursday, October 29</b> in the exam centre. 
You should be proficient in all material contained in Chapter 2. More precisely:
  * Be able to compute a derivative from first principles.
  * Be able to approximate the value of a derivative from either a table or graph.
  * Be able to sketch the derivative of a function given a graph of the function and vice versa, the graph of a function given the derivative.
  * Be able to apply the various derivative rules: sum/difference rule, constant multiple rule, power rule, product rule, quotient rule, chain rule (this is of course the vast majority of the test, either directly or indirectly)
    * Note: This is true both for given functions as well as given a table of values for f(x), g(x), f'(x), g'(x).
  * Be able to use derivatives to find the equation of tangent/normal lines with a given slope and through a point or parallel/perpendicular to given lines.
  * Be able to compute dy/dx implicitly, and to find the slope of the tangent to an implicit curve at a point.
  * Be able to compute higher-order derivatives.
  * Be able to compute higher-order implicit derivatives.
There will also be several bonus questions which test your understanding at a deeper level.
Hours are:
  * Saturday, October 24, 11AM-2PM
  * Monday, October 26, 4PM-7PM
  * Thursday, October 29, 4PM-7PM
I will not be answering questions regarding Chapter 2 starting Thursday, October 22 at 4PM, treating it as if the exam has started for everyone. This also means that you are not to discuss any aspects of the test with anyone until after Monday at 7PM, in order to maintain integrity of the exam. Please let me know ASAP if you cannot write at one of these times, and we will have to make alternate arrangements (such as during class).

Chapter 1 test is scheduled for <b>Monday, September 28 - Saturday, October 3</b> in the exam centre. 
You should be proficient in all material contained in Chapter 1 plus limits at infinity and types of discontinuities. More precisely:
  * Know how to compute a limit of a function both graphically and algebraically via 4 techniques:
    * Technique 0: rational-like function evaluation
    * Technique 1: factor and reduce
    * Technique 2: rationalize
    * Technique 3: (for x approaching +/- infinity) divide by highest power in the denominator
  * Know how to compute a one-sided limit, including checking for signs in absolute values and values close to 0
  * Know how to compute a limit via one-sided limits
  * Determine where a function is continuous, or find values for constants which give continuity 
  * Be able to identify the type of a discontinuity
  * Be able to compute the slope and equation of a tangent line from first principles (i.e. the limit of the quotient definition)
  * Know how to find velocity and other rates of change (i.e. applications of slope) from first principles
  * Be able to compute the average rate of change or approximate the instantaneous rate of change from a table of values or graph
  * Be able to compute limits of sequences (geometric, using the dividing by highest power trick, or identifying the behaviour in general)
  * Be able to compute the sum of a series, either using the limit of the partial sums or, in the special case of a geometric series, using the formula derived in class
  * Demonstrate converting a repeating decimal to a fraction in lowest terms
There will also be several bonus questions which test your understanding at a deeper level.

### Homework

Homework expectations: 30-40 minutes/day on average

Homework for Wednesday, Nov. 18:
  * Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/CE8dHYnujxhRCDB57">feedback form</a>. It is anonymous, so feel free to express your honest opinion(s).
  * Do problems from 4.3 as best you can.
  * Note about 4.2: For Q8, don't use Newton's method, just use a graphing calculator to find the roots.

Homework for Monday, Nov. 16 (over the break):
  * Do problems from 4.2 (should take you 1 day)
  * Reflect on your Chapter 2 test and write down:
    * Issues you may have had (not understanding something, not writing enough proof, calculation errors, etc) (If you did well, reflect on why you were successful)
    * What you will do in the future to prepare for tests
    * Compare with your reflection following Chapter 1: Did you meet your goals? Did you follow through with what you said you would do?

Homework for Wednesday, Nov. 4:
  * Do problems from 4.1.

  * <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020Calculus/practice_derivatives.pdf"> A collection of 43 multiple-choice questions</a>
    * Q3: Option A should read "h \to 0", not "a \to 0" under the limit.
    * Q11: This is not a great question, but is correct if you assume the scale is exactly the same as above. You need to have good eyes! (or a ruler...) If I had this on a test, I would put the graph of f on the same axes so you can directly compare them.
    * Q12: This is beyond the class material (and is flawed - none of the choices are correct).
    * Q14: Come see me if you need an answer.
    * Q16, Q18: Requires a calculator - ignore for the purposes of the test, but try it out to test your understanding.
    * Q19: Should read df/dx, not dy/dx (or it shoud say y = ... rather than f(x) = ...)
    * Q29: Options A and C are identical.
    * Q31: Notation: D_x means d/dx, and D_x^2 means d^2/dx^2.
    * Q33: This is (algebraically) challenging, and has several answers (one which uses the original formula to simplify, and one which does not - both versions are valid in my mind).
    * Q42, Q43: These questions are part of Chapter 3, not Chapter 2.
