# Grade 4 Mathematics

### Announcements

Note for the activity from today. The last three columns of the table you need to fill out are:
  * Volume (cm<sup>3</sup>)
  * Density (g/cm<sup>3</sup>) (to 3 decimal places)
  * Volume of box needed for 500 g of pasta (cm<sup>3</sup>) (to the nearest whole number)

For example, if the dimensions of a box is 10 cm by 10 cm by 20 cm with a mass of 400 g, then the volume is 10&#215;10&#215;20 = 2000 cm<sup>3</sup>, the density is 400/2000 = 0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, and the volume of box needed for 500 g of pasta is 500/0.2 = 2500 cm<sup>3</sup>.

Homework expectations: 20-25 minutes/day

Optional work for next week: create your own <a href="https://solveme.edc.org/mobiles/">mobile balance puzzles</a>.

Specific homework for Thursday, Feb. 4:
  * Write down your mathemagic trick in clearly defined steps as you would explain to an audience, and include a proof using algebra to show why your trick works.

Specific homework for Monday, Jan. 25:
  * Finish questions 1)a), 2)a), 3)a), and 4)a) from the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/algebra/Algebra.pdf">"Misc. algebra problems" handout</a>. You must show all of your work, neatly and clearly. You may use a calculator.

Specific homework for Thursday, Jan. 14:
  * Finish the table from the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/Activities/Packing-Pasta-handout.pdf">pasta packing activity</a>.

Specific homework for Monday, Jan. 4:
  * Complete Reviews A (no calculator) and B (calculator allowed). Your parents have the links. 

Over the break, try to spend an average of 20 minutes on math per day. This time should be spent on: 
  * Reviews A and B,
  * mental math (can be done orally with a parent, for e.g.)
  * math puzzles (e.g. sudoku, inkies, pixel puzzles, logic puzzles - some can be found on my <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020logicpuzzles.html">logic elective website</a>)
  * math games (e.g. 3 or 4-dice, aggression, 24, non-arcade <a href="mathplayground.com/">mathplayground games</a>)
  * <a href="https://ca.ixl.com/">IXL</a> (if you want to use IXL and do not have an active account, I need to know)
  * math contests
  * workbook power builders, final review, corrections, or content that is generally review/understood
  * the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/Challenges/2020-21Winter_Break.pdf">Winter Break math challenges</a>
