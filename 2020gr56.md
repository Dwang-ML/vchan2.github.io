# Grade 5/6 Mathematics

### Announcements

<b>NOTICE:</b> The CMGC (Canadian Mathematical Gray jay Competition) will take place on Thursday, October 8. You will be writing in room 2104 (next to the entrance of the senior building), except for Kahil, Anna, Oliver, Arjun, who will write in 2204, from 8:30-10:15 - we hope to begin the competition at 8:30 so you miss as little of period 2 as possible. Bring pencils and erasers; no calculators are allowed. When you are finished the contest, you may go to your period 2 class (there's really no reason you finish during period 1 before the sanitation bell).

Homework expectations: 25-30 minutes/day

  * Finish the shape algebra series 0 and 1.
