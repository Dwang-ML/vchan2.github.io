<!--
Specific homework for Monday, June 21:
  * Fill out the End of Year feedback form (link available on Schoology)
Specific homework for Tuesday, June 8:
  * Make a copy of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sd3U_BpCH6cc2I2BII17FAu8l3euVEq39oqJjDm8eLA/edit?usp=sharing">Pokemon data</a> (click on "File", then "Make a copy")
  * Play around with the graphs you can make using this data (click on "Insert", then "Chart"). You should have at least 2 different graphs/charts, but feel free to explore as many as you would like. Note: you should be using the data from the first tab, "Simplified_data", unless you would like to explore more variables and work with the data from the second tab, "Raw_data".
Specific homework for Thursday, June 3:
  * Fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/wNsXz2XbZ79ec1Gh8">this form</a> to submit your answers for the distance estimation.
Specific homework for Tuesday, May 4:
  * Create a tessellation, either digitally or on paper, using translations, reflections, or rotations. Feel free to add design embellishments, similar to the Escher tessellations we looked at in class. We will have a competition in-class to find the most interesting design! (For the tessellation project, you don't need more than 3x3 = 9 tiles in your tessellation, just to show how the tessellation works. In more complex tessellations, it turns out 9 might not be enough, but for the types of tessellations we did, it will be. Some people are experiencing difficulty with geogebra running too slowly when you have too many objects.)
Specific homework for Tuesday, April 27:
  * Practice making a single PDF of your "solutions" and uploading using the google form
Specific homework for Monday, April 26:
  * Play around with your translation tessellation. You may want to create a tessellation on paper based on your digital model.
