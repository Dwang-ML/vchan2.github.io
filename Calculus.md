### Updates
Tentative schedule:

Monday, May 4: everyone in my room - we will be going over a few AB-specific problems focusing on tabular, graphical, and verbal-type questions.

Tuesday, May 5: everyone in my room - we will be doing a practice exam; AB people will do an AB-specific exam while BC people will do a BC-specific exam (exam 1).

Wednesday, May 6 (periods 3 and 4): AB people in Mr. Merrick's room and BC people in my room - we will be going over exam 1 (it may not take both periods).

Thursday, May 7: everyone in my room - we will be doing a practice exam; AB people will do an AB-specific exam while BC people will do a BC-specific exam (exam 2).

Friday, May 8: (periods 3 and 4): AB people in Mr. Merrick's room and BC people in my room - we will be going over exam 2 (it may not take both periods). I realize you all have class in period 3: I have talked to Dr. Renert about it, but this is still unconfirmed (hence the "tentative").

Monday, May 11: everyone in my room - we will be doing random review problems and answering any last-minute questions.

Tuesday, May 12: exam is at 12PM!

After the exam date:

Wednesdays: if there is interest, during the usual "BC AP Calculus" choice, we can go over further material which is normally taught in a university-level calculus course. There may be portions which are either easier with BC-specific material, or require BC-specific material.

Up to and including Friday, May 22: Mr. Merrick will be doing AP Statistics in his room for those interested in pursuing the exam. Everyone else will be in my room.

FYI if you're in a bind for time, focus on tabular and graphical first, then verbal, then algebraic. I've arranged these based on likelihood of appearing on the exam.
