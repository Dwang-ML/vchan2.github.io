### Updates
* AB Calculus people: We are done all the content for your exam, but there is still lots to do - we need to practice hard word problems and problems that incorporate multiple ideas. Please continue coming to class in case we have class activities, though much of class time will be used for the BC Calculus people.
* I have put together a review test for you on the AP Classroom website, called "Review 01." There are 18 questions, with some short and some long questions, covering most of the topics we need to know for the exam. Note that Unit 7 is not very well represented in this review test, because we just finished learning the material and thus it should still be fresh. You should be able to finish the entire test within 180 minutes, so I expect everyone to be finished by Wednesday, April 22.
