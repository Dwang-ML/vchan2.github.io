### Updates
* You are welcome to enter a break-out room by yourself or with other people. Please let me know via chat if you'd like to do this at any time during class and I will make it happen. While you're in a breakout room, you can ask for my help at any time and I will get to you as soon as possible. In the main session, I will be answering any general questions, going over strategies, and/or solving harder puzzles in real-time with commentary.
