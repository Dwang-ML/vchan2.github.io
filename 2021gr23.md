Homework for Monday, June 14:
 * Estimate: How old you are in years if you are 1 million seconds old? What about 1 billion seconds old?
 * Estimate: If you combine all of the liquid you will drink over your entire life, how many bathtubs would it fill? (Remember to have an educated guess with calculations - no wild guesses!)
Homework for Monday, June 7:
 * Try to complete the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/level1_2021">2021 CESMC lvl 1</a> handed out in class.
Homework for Thursday, June 3:
 * Multiply the number of steps by the length of each step for each person in your group. You should end up with 4 estimates of the distance required.
Homework for Monday, May 3:
 * Try to match the Euler diagrams with the list of properties on <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/Venn-Puzzler.pdf"> this sheet</a> (<a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/Venn-Puzzler(solved).jpg">Here are the solutions we came up with as a class</a>)
Homework for Tuesday, April 27:
 * Try to create a Venn diagram with 4 properties. Remember, it needs to have 2^4 = 16 regions which represent different combinations of properties!
Specific homework for Thursday, March 4:
  * Complete the last 4 columns for each of the 4 objects in the circle measurement activity. You may use a calculator, and you may get help from a parent, especially for working with the decimals.
Specific homework for Monday, November 23:
  * Complete the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/POTWA-20-NN-09-P.pdf">Problem of the Week</a> which we worked on today. You should have an organized answer which shows all your work. For each type of supply, you should have (at the very least): number of supplies needed for the class, number of packages needed, and subtotal for that supply, as well as the calculations you used. For example: we need 5 &#215; 20 = 100 pencils for the class, which is 100 &#247; 10 = 10 packages, which gives a subtotal of 10 &#215; $0.50 = $5.00. This information should be summarized in a table. Neatness counts! Your answer should be stand-alone - that is, anyone should be able to read your solution and understand exactly what you did. If your solution is longer than one page, make sure you write single-sided.
Specific homework for Monday, November 16:
  * Complete all 8 <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/fallbreak_HW.pdf">multiplication tables</a>.
Specific homework for Monday, October 26:
  * Record your times for your count-by's <a href="https://forms.gle/NhR9cxXSjpTFbFQd6"> here</a>.
Specific homework for Monday, September 21:
  * Finish your subtraction worksheets (counts towards your daily math)
Specific homework for Thursday, September 3, 2020:
  * Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/7Cr4h1FoWTxSz2TD8">update form</a>.
  * Sign the course outline, have your parents sign it, and bring it to class.
  * Finish your "biography sheet" with the 4 questions.
  * Have an answer to the questions: "What is the purpose of a teacher?" and "What is the purpose of learning math?"
