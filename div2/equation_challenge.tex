\textbf{Equation Challenge}
\end{center}

The golden rule of solving equations is that we must do the same thing to both sides of the equation. Give an example of an equation and an operation you perform (correctly) to both sides of the equation which results in an incorrect solution set. That is, start with equation 1, do something to both sides to result in equation 2, and the solution(s) to equation 2 is/are not the same as the solution(s) to equation 1.
