<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays on the 4th floor. This class is <b>mandatory</b> for those who scored below 80% on a unit test, but highly encouraged for anyone who is struggling or unsure about any of the material. Otherwise, please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. Please let me know in advance if you intend to come; I will typically come for the first few minutes to see if anyone shows up.

<!--
<b>Notice:</b> In Stewart, 9.3 Q7, 8, 15 use integration by parts - skip it.
FYI: the sections 7.6 and 7.7 in the third packet I handed out (contains CA #1 and CA #2 for each section) are good additional practice for the differential equations test.
For 7.7, Q5 and 7 on CA #1 and CA #2 are related to section 7.4, which we haven't finished yet, and will not be tested. 
(Packets can be found in their usual spot, shared notes -> textbook chapters and practice problems -> Unit 7)

<b>NOTICE:</b> I will be offering "Captivating Calculus" in period 5 on Choice Fridays in my zoom room. Please use this as an additional opportunity to get help with calculus, or to come ask deeper questions that we don't have time for in class. If you don't have any questions, feel free to come by anyway for your lunch hour to hang out in case any questions arise from others. Please note that if we do fall behind again, I will be using the "Captivating Calculus" as a mandatory class instead, but I'm hoping it won't come to that - in fact, I'm hoping we'll be finished with the material early, to give plenty of time for practice.

Section 3.5 corrections:
  * Q8 should be 20 &#215; 3^(1/4) ~ 26.32, not 20/sqrt(3) ~ 11.55.
  * Q15 is technically incorrect: the question tells you the plane is 20 km from Quinton, so that should mean direct distance (indeed, you are looking for the rate of change of the distance, which they are assuming means direct distance). If you assume the 20 km refers to horizontal distance (but you're trying to find the rate of change of direct distance still). then their answer is correct, 240 &#215; sqrt(5). However, the correct interpretation should yield 300 &#215; sqrt(3). If I were to use a question like this on a test, I would explicitly state "when it is 20 km horizontally from Quinton" vs "when it is directly 20 km away from Quinton" or something to that effect.
