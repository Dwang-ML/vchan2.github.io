# Grade 6 Mathematics

### Announcements

Algebraic equations test on Thursday, April 11

Alice has some nickels, dimes, and quarters. They have a combined value of $3.25. There are 8 more coins among the nickels than there are among the dimes and quarters. If she spends 2/5 of her nickels and 2 of her dimes, then the value of her nickels would be double the value of her dimes. How many of each type of coin did she begin with?
