<!--
For Tuesday, April 14: 
* Keep working through workbooks.
* Keep working through IXL problems related to algebra. You may find the grade 7 unit U a little too easy, especially compared to what we do in class - some harder ones can be found at higher grades, such as: Grade 10, G.5, and Grade 11, B.1.
