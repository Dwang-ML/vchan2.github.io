# Grade 2/3 Mathematics

### Announcements

Homework expectations: 15-20 minutes/day

Specific homework for Monday, November 23:
  * Complete the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/POTWA-20-NN-09-P.pdf">Problem of the Week</a> which we worked on today. You should have an organized answer which shows all your work. For each type of supply, you should have (at the very least): number of supplies needed for the class, number of packages needed, and subtotal for that supply, as well as the calculations you used. For example: we need 5 &#215; 20 = 100 pencils for the class, which is 100 &#247; 10 = 10 packages, which gives a subtotal of 10 &#215; $0.50 = $5.00. This information should be summarized in a table. Neatness counts! Your answer should be stand-alone - that is, anyone should be able to read your solution and understand exactly what you did.

Specific homework for Monday, November 16:
  * Complete all 8 <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/fallbreak_HW.pdf">multiplication tables</a>.

Over the break, spend at least 15 minutes on math per day. This time should be spent on: 
  * the <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020gr23/fallbreak_HW.pdf">multiplication tables</a>,
  * mental math (can be done orally with a parent, for e.g.)
  * math puzzles (e.g. sudoku, inkies, pixel puzzles, logic puzzles - some can be found on my <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2020logicpuzzles.html">logic elective website</a>)
  * math games (e.g. 3 or 4-dice, aggression, 24, non-arcade <a href="mathplayground.com/">mathplayground games</a>)
  * <a href="https://ca.ixl.com/">IXL</a> (grade 3 and up)
