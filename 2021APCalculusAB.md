<!--
AP Calculus Final Exam on Monday, May 24, in-school.
-->

<!--
<b>Notice:</b> In Stewart, 9.3 Q7, 8, 15 use integration by parts - skip it.
FYI: the sections 7.6 and 7.7 in the third packet I handed out (contains CA #1 and CA #2 for each section) are good additional practice for the differential equations test.
For 7.7, Q5 and 7 on CA #1 and CA #2 are related to section 7.4, which we haven't finished yet, and will not be tested. 
(Packets can be found in their usual spot, shared notes -> textbook chapters and practice problems -> Unit 7)

<a href="https://renertmath.github.io/pi">&pi;-day information</a>
-->

<!--
I wanted to clarify something we did in class that I spoke about, but didn't write down explicitly: the derivative of arccos(cos x) is only for sure 1 on the interval [0,&pi;], where we're using the restricted domain. I want to emphasize that this is not the "true" derivative in the most general sense, which is actually 1 on the interval [2&pi;n,&pi;+2&pi;n], and is -1 otherwise. I leave as an exercise to see why, either using the chain rule or reducing the argument in arccos(cos x) and using reflection identities. We'll talk more about this at a later time, when we get into AP calculus material.

Please note that if we do fall behind again, I will be using the "Captivating Calculus" as a mandatory class instead, but I'm hoping it won't come to that - in fact, I'm hoping we'll be finished with the material early, to give plenty of time for practice.

Section 3.5 corrections:
  * Q8 should be 20 &#215; 3^(1/4) ~ 26.32, not 20/sqrt(3) ~ 11.55.
  * Q15 is technically incorrect: the question tells you the plane is 20 km from Quinton, so that should mean direct distance (indeed, you are looking for the rate of change of the distance, which they are assuming means direct distance). If you assume the 20 km refers to horizontal distance (but you're trying to find the rate of change of direct distance still). then their answer is correct, 240 &#215; sqrt(5). However, the correct interpretation should yield 300 &#215; sqrt(3). If I were to use a question like this on a test, I would explicitly state "when it is 20 km horizontally from Quinton" vs "when it is directally 20 km away from Quinton" or something to that effect.

### Exams

Unless otherwise specified, all material is contained in the AP exam. Those items with an (AP) tag could appear on an AP exam, but not a Math 31 exam. 

<!--
Unit 1 Math 31 test is scheduled for <b>Wednesday, September 29</b> in-class. Unit 1 AP material is scheduled for <b>Friday, October 1</b> in-class. 
You should be proficient in all material contained in Unit 1. More precisely, you should be able to:
  * Compute limits of a function graphically.
  * (AP) Compute limits of a composite function graphically.
  * Interpret tabular information for finding limits.
  * Use limit properties and arithmetic to find limits .
  * Compute a limit of a function algebraically via 4 techniques:
    * Technique 0: rational-like function evaluation
    * Technique 1: factor and reduce
    * Technique 2: rationalize
    * Technique 3: Fundamental Trigonometric Limit
    * Technique 4: (for x approaching +/- infinity) divide by dominant terms in the denominator
      * (AP) Apply this technique for expressions involving radicals
  * Compute a one-sided limit, including checking for signs in absolute values and values close to 0.
  * Find a limit via one-sided limits.
  * Determine where a function is continuous, or find values for constants which give continuity.
  * Identify the type of a discontinuity.
  * Find vertical and horizontal asymptotes of a function.
  * (AP) Use Squeeze Theorem.
  * (AP) Use Intermediate Value Theorem.
  * (AP) Handle more challenging expressions involving trigonometric functions, exponentials, and logarithms.
-->

<!--
Unit 2 test is scheduled for <b>Wednesday, October 11</b> in-class. Unit 2 AP material is scheduled for <b>Friday, October 13</b> in-class.

  * Describe the relationship between continuity and differentiability.
  * Calculate the average rate of change from a table, graph, or function.

  * Sketch the derivative of a function given a graph of the function and vice versa, the graph of a function given the derivative.
  * Apply the various derivative rules: sum/difference rule, constant multiple rule, power rule, product rule, quotient rule (this is of course the vast majority of the test, either directly or indirectly)
    * Note: This is true both for given functions (involving powers, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, and logarithmic functions) as well as given a table of values for f(x), g(x), f'(x), g'(x).
  * (Math 31 ONLY) Produce <a href="https://vchan2.github.io/2021Calculus/Trig_derivatives_proofs.pdf">proofs for the derivatives of the trigonometric functions</a>.

    * Q3: Option A should read "h \to 0", not "a \to 0" under the limit.
    * Q11: This is not a great question, but is correct if you assume the scale is exactly the same as above. You need to have good eyes! (or a ruler...) If I had this on a test, I would put the graph of f on the same axes so you can directly compare them.
    * Q12: This is beyond the class material (and is flawed - none of the choices are correct).
    * Q14: Come see me if you need an answer.
    * Q16, Q18: Requires a calculator - ignore for the purposes of the test, but try it out to test your understanding.
    * Q19: Should read df/dx, not dy/dx (or it shoud say y = ... rather than f(x) = ...)
    * Q29: Options A and C are identical.
    * Q31: Notation: D_x means d/dx, and D_x^2 means d^2/dx^2.
    * Q33: This is (algebraically) challenging, and has several answers (one which uses the original formula to simplify, and one which does not - both versions are valid in my mind).
    * Q42, Q43: These questions are part of Chapter 3, not Chapter 2.
